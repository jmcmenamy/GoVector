# GoVector

GoVector is a logging library for making [DisViz](https://github.com/jmcmenamy/disviz)-compatible logs. The `GoLog` object adds a process id and vector clock to every log event.

See this [README](https://github.com/jmcmenamy/meng_project?tab=readme-ov-file#govector) for a description of this tool and how to use it.
